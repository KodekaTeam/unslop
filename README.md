# Unslop

`unslop` is a reusable instruction package for producing software changes that are contextual, evidence-based, and free from a generic template feel. It is not a collection of stylistic prohibitions. Its core principle is to make decisions from project evidence, preserve real functionality, and verify the resulting changes.

## Key differences

- Routing is divided by type of work rather than overlapping lists of anti-patterns.
- UI creation and UI auditing are separate, preventing implementation requests from turning into read-only audits.
- Extensive visual guidance uses progressive disclosure through `references/`.
- Each skill has a specific name and description to improve implicit invocation accuracy.
- Shared baseline rules live in `AGENTS.md`; specialist details are loaded only when relevant.

## Structure

```text
unslop/
|-- AGENTS.md
|-- INSTALL.md
|-- principles/
    |-- README.md
    |-- documentation-continuity.md
`-- .agents/
    `-- skills/
        |-- unslop-ui/
        |-- unslop-ui-audit/
        |-- unslop-responsive/
        |-- unslop-accessibility/

        |-- unslop-logic/
        |-- unslop-lean/
        `-- unslop-docs/
```

## Usage

Copy `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/` into the target repository root. If the repository already has an `AGENTS.md`, merge the relevant sections without removing existing project commands, domain rules, or validation instructions.

Skills can be invoked explicitly, such as with `$unslop-ui`, while their descriptions are also designed for automatic selection. Installation details are available in `INSTALL.md`.

Step-by-step guides are available in [`tutorial/english/`](tutorial/english/README.md), covering installation and routing as well as documentation bootstrapping and session continuity.

## Output principles

Unslop prioritizes:

- local evidence over generic preferences;
- hierarchy and task flow before decoration;
- honest data and claims;
- controls and states that actually work;
- accessibility and responsive behavior as part of quality;
- small solutions that preserve correctness;
- verification proportionate to the risk of the change.

The briefs and rationale used to develop the documentation workflow live in `principles/`. That directory is intended for package maintainers; portable runtime instructions remain in `.agents/skills/unslop-docs/`.

Explicit user instructions and more specific project rules always take precedence over this package's general preferences.
