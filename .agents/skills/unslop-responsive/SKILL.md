description: Implement or repair responsive web and app layouts across narrow, wide, zoomed, and touch-oriented viewports. Use for reflow, overflow, adaptive navigation, content-driven breakpoints, and mobile interaction layout. Do not use for purely visual styling with no responsive impact.

# Unslop Responsive

Make the same task usable across available space and input conditions. Responsive work is re-composition, not desktop shrinkage.

## Diagnose from content

- Identify the first width where reading order, controls, data, or navigation stop working.
- Trace the element that establishes the bad width; do not hide page overflow before finding its source.
- Inspect fixed widths, minimum sizes, grid tracks, unbreakable text, positioned elements, media, tables, and viewport units.
- Test with realistic long labels and dense content, not only an empty happy path.

Choose breakpoints where the composition fails. Device names may be test targets, but they are not design evidence.

## Recompose deliberately

- Preserve task order when columns stack. Source order should remain meaningful.
- Collapse, wrap, scroll a bounded data region, or change representation based on content needs.
- Let grids use the fewest columns that keep each item useful. Do not retain a desktop grid merely for symmetry.
- Scale type and spacing within readable limits; avoid shrinking controls and text until they technically fit.
- Prefer dynamic viewport units and content-based minimums where browser chrome or keyboards affect available space.
- Reserve fixed positioning for elements whose persistent availability justifies the space they consume.

## Navigation and touch

- Adapt navigation before labels collide or targets become too small.
- Keep the current location visible and make collapsed menus operable with keyboard and touch.
- Ensure persistent headers, bottom bars, dialogs, and virtual keyboards do not cover content or focused fields.
- Give controls sufficient target area and separation. The visible icon may be smaller than its interactive area.
- Do not rely on hover for disclosure or essential actions.

## Overflow decisions

- Fix unintended page-level horizontal scrolling at its owner.
- Allow intentional local scrolling for wide tables, timelines, or canvases and provide a clear visual boundary.
- Do not use `overflow: hidden` to conceal text, focus rings, menus, or broken layout.
- Allow long tokens to wrap or truncate only when the complete value remains accessible.

## Verification matrix

Test the changed surface at:

- its widest supported composition;
- just above and below each affected breakpoint;
- a narrow phone-sized viewport;
- text zoom or browser zoom relevant to the platform;
- short and long content;
- keyboard focus and an open mobile keyboard for changed forms.

Verify no accidental page overflow, clipping, overlap, inaccessible actions, or order changes. Report representative dimensions and anything not exercised.
